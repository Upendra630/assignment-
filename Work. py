List - lists are used to store multiple
       items in a single variable
Examples of list in python
var = ["Geeks","for","Geeks"]
print(var)
Output
["Geeks","for","Geeks"]
# creating a list
List = [ ]
Print("Blank list:")
Print (list)
# creating a list of numbers
List = [10,20,30]
 Print ("\n list of numbers:")
Print (List)
Output
Blank list:
[]
List of numbers:
[10,20,30]
These are the examples of list

2 Dictionary - dictionary is a collection of
               keys values, used to store data
               Values like a map
Examples of dictionary
Dict = {1: 'Geeks',2:'For',3:'Geeks'}
Print (Dict)
Output
{1: 'Geeks',2:'For',3:'Geeks'}
# creating a dictionary
# with integer keys
Dict = {1: 'Geeks',2:'For',3:'Geeks'}
 Print ("\nDictionary with the use of integer keys:")
Print (Dict)
# creating a dictionary
# with mixedkeys
Dict = {'Name':'Geeks',1:[1,2,3,4]}
 Print ("\nDictionary with the use of mixed keys:")
Print (Dict)
Output
Dictionary with the use of integer keys
{1: 'Geeks',2:'For',3:'Geeks'}
Dictionary with the use of mixed keys
{'Name':'Geeks',1:[1,2,3,4]}
3 Tuples - Tuple is a collection of python
           Objects much like a list. The
           Sequence of values stored in a
           Tuple can be of any type and they
          Are indexed by integers
  Examples of Tuple
# creating a Tuple
# with the use of string
Tuple1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Print ('Geeks','For')
 Print (\nTuple with the use of string)
Print (Tuple1)
# creating a Tuple
# with the use of built-in function
Tuple1 = Tuple('Geeks')
 Print ("\nTuple with the use of function: ")
Print (Tuple1)
Output
Initial empty Tuple:
()
Tuple with the use of string:
('Geeks','For')
Tuple with the use of function:
('G','e','e','k','s')

 #negative slicing
 
 #1
 c=datascience
 print(c[-5,-1])
 #2
 c=[1,2,3,4,5]
 print(c[-4,-1])
 
 # frozen set
 
 # frozen set is immutable  can not be  modified
#1

a=list[-1]
b=list[-2]
print(a,b)
